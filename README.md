# Welcome to the Roadmapping wiki of Hanson Robotics software!

We intend this repository to contain all our plans, brainstorms, dreams, memes, emes, schemes, and related reference materials. Serving both an index and a living roadmap, this wiki should model our long term goals, specific tasks for a given month's sprint, and architecture and component designs. Please put all your notes here.

With our efforts, we intend to create (a strong illusion of) human life within interactive characters, both virtual and robotic. In pursuit of this goal, our software includes/integrates many features and platforms, including artistic animation, robotic controls, machine perception, natural language dialogue, machine learning and AI. The software and its pieces may serve many purposes including research, entertainment, and medical applications. Feel free to add new descriptions of features, uses, ideas, opinions, and feedback from field deployments and tests. 

We keenly appreciate that many groups and people are working in related areas, and we thank our many collaborators including Open Cog, Cogbot, iCog, the NextGen Systems Group, etc.

Please participate, contribute and help bring intelligent characters to life!
